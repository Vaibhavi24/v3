### 1. Retrieve a card from a stack

- Note that the array index starts from `0`. [Here][access_array_elements_resource] you can find more information about how to access array elements.

### 2. Exchange a card in the stack

- The array is a mutable structure, you can change its content anytime.

### 3. Create a stack of cards

- The `push` method adds a new value at the end of the array. [Here][push_method_docs] you can find documentation and an example for the `push` method.
 
### 4. Remove a card from the stack

- `splice` is a versatile method, which among other use cases, can be used to remove elements starting at a certain position. [Here][splice_method_docs] you can find documentation and an example for the `splice` method.

### 5. Remove the top card from the stack

- The `pop` method removes the last element from the array. [Here][pop_method_docs] you can find documentation and an example for the `pop` method.

### 6. Check size of the stack

- Any array's length can be determined by using the `length` property on the array object. [Here][length_property_docs] you can find documentation and an example for the `length` property.
